**Prevention:** N/A

## 2025-12-20 - [Weak Default Authentication]
**Vulnerability:** Enabled SSH password authentication combined with a known/weak initial password ("changeme").

**Prevention:** Explicitly disable password-based authentication for critical services like SSH and enforce key-based authentication.
